            <p style="font-family: Rock Salt">Here's what you'll need to make <strong>Honeydukes</strong> famous <strong>chunky nougat fudge</strong>:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>1 package (8.6 ounces) Pepperidge Farm® Soft Baked Montauk™ Milk Chocolate Cookies, coarsely crumbled (about 2 cups) </li>
                <li>1 cup miniature marshmallows </li>
                <li>18 ounces semi-sweet chocolate pieces </li>
                <li>1 can (14 ounces) sweetened condensed milk </li>
                <li>1/8 teaspoon salt </li>
<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract </li>
                <li>Edible gel of any color of your choice, we reccomend green because it is visible on the chocolate and can be associated with HOneydukes</li>
            </ol>
            <p><span>How To Make It</span></p>
<p style="font-family: Fantasy">1. Reserve 1/2 cup crumbled cookies and 1/4 cup marshmallows. Line an 8x8x2-inch baking pan with foil, leaving a few inches on each end to use as handles. Spray the foil with vegetable cooking spray.</p>
<p style="font-family: Fantasy">2. Heat the chocolate pieces, condensed milk and salt in a 2-quart saucepan over low heat until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth, stirring often.</p>
<p style="font-family: Fantasy">3. Remove the saucepan from the heat.  Stir in the remaining crumbled cookies, marshmallows and the vanilla extract. Spread the chocolate mixture in the pan.  Press the reserved crumbled cookies and marshmallows into the top.</p>
<p style="font-family: Fantasy">4. Refrigerate for 2 hours or until firm.  Remove the fudge from the pan using the foil handles and peel away the foil.  Cut into 16 squares.  Store in the refrigerator in a covered container.</p>
            <p style="font-family: Fantasy"> When you have finished with this step, write 'Honeydukes' in your edible gel or a different message of your choice on each square of fudge! DONE! </p>

            <p>Honeydukes Express</p>
            
            <p>Yields 12 cauldrons
12 devil's food cupcakes 
1 recipe for Chocolate Glaze (below) 
1 recipe for Marshmallow Filling (below) 
Approximately 1/2 cup chocolate chips 
Edible gold glitter
Chocolate Glaze 
6 ounces (1 cup) semi-sweet chocolate chips 
4 tablespoons butter
In a double boiler, melt together the chocolate and butter, stirring until smooth. Glaze will be relatively thick. Remove from heat and let sit 5 minutes before use. If chocolate thickens too much, return to heat and stir until smooth and melted once more.
Marshmallow Filling 
1 cup Marshmallow Fluff (or prepared marshmallow cream) 
1/2 cup vegetable shortening 
1/2 cup confectioners sugar 
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
In a medium bowl, beat together the marshmallow fluff, shortening, sugar, and vanilla extract until light and fluffy, about 3-5 minutes.
To assemble
Using a cupcake corer or sharp knife, cut out a cavity in the bottom of the cupcake. When using a knife, I run it in a circular motion around the cupcake, while always pointing the knife towards the center (this will make the cavity cone shaped).
Dip the top of the cupcake into the chocolate glaze. Flip the cupcakes right side up and let rest until the chocolate sets, about 30 minutes. To speed up the process, place cupcakes in the refrigerator.
To make the cauldron feet, take 3 chocolate chips and form a small triangle, placing each chocolate chip roughly an inch from the others. Place the top of a cupcake onto the chocolate chips and push down ever so slightly so the chocolate chips will stick into the chocolate glaze. Repeat for the rest of the cupcakes.
Place remaining chocolate glaze into a piping bag and pipe a chocolate rim around the edge of the opening to the cauldron. If chocolate is too thick to pipe, heat chocolate glaze up until warm and allow to sit until glaze thickens slightly. If chocolate glaze is too runny to pipe, wait a few minutes until the glaze thickens to a pipe-able consistency. Alternatively, you could use a knife to spread the glaze around the edge of the cupcake.
Fill a pastry bag with marshmallow filling and pipe into the cavity of the cupcakes. Garnish the top with edible gold glitter.
To make cauldron handle, melt the remaining chocolate chips, stir until smooth, and place into a pastry bag. You don't need a special tip for this step; I simply cut off the very end of the pastry bag which was sufficient. On a non-stick mat or wax paper, pipe out the handles (feel free to use any pattern you'd like). I recommend measuring the cupcakes with a ruler to determine how wide you need to make the handles before piping. Let the chocolate set until hardened, approximately 30 minutes, before very carefully peeling off of the non-stick surface and placing into the top of each cupcake.
And you're done! Eat and enjoy.</p>
            
            <p>Ingredients

2 eggs, slightly beaten

3/4 cup sugar

2 cups fresh sugar pumkin (or 1lb. canned)

1/2 teaspoon salt

2 tbs. melted butter

1 tsp. cinnamon

1/2 tsp. ginger

1/2 tsp. cloves

1/2 tsp. cardamon

1/2 tsp. allspice

1 can evaporated milk

18 oz. pie crust pastry (enough for four single standard pie crusts)


Directions:
If you don't know how to prep fresh pumpkin, here's some instructions.
Add eggs and sugar to a mixing bowl and mix until well blended. Stir in the pumpkin, butter, salt and spices. Add evaporated milk and mix well. Bake the filling in a large casserole dish that has been buttered or sprayed with pam. Bake at 425 degrees for 15 minutes. Reduce temperature to 350 degrees and continue baking for 45 minutes or until your fork comes out clean. Let the filling cool completely. Make or purchase pie crust pastry. Roll pastry thin and cut into circles about 4 inches in diameter. Put a spoonful of the pumpkin mixture towards one side of the center of the circle. Fold over the crust into a half-circle and firmly crimp the edges closed. Cut with a paring knife three small slits in the top for venting. Place on a greased cookie sheet. Bake at 400 degrees only until crust is a light golden brown, around 10 minutes. Brush each with some butter and dust with cinnamon and sugar.

            <p>The three Broomstick's Spiffed-Up Shepherd’s Pie and Mashed Potatoes:

adapted from the Beef Information Centre.

1 onion, chopped
1 lb (500 g) ground sirloin or extra-lean ground beef
1/4 tsp (1mL) dried thyme
Pepper
1/4 cup (50 mL) Worcestershire sauce
2 tbsp (30 mL) tomato paste
1 tbsp (15 mL) all-purpose flour
2 cups (500 mL) frozen mixed vegetables
1 cup (250 mL) low-sodium beef stock
Buttermilk mashed potatoes (recipe follows)
1/2-1 cup grated cheddar cheese

•	Cook onion, beef, thyme and pepper (to taste) in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat, breaking up meat with wooden spoon, until beef is browned and onion is softened, about 10 minutes.
•	Reduce heat to medium; stir in Worcestershire Sauce, tomato paste and flour. Stir in vegetables and stock; simmer until slightly thickened, about 3 minutes. Divide into ramekins or small gratin dishes.
•	Stir half of the cheddar into the Buttermilk Mashed Potatoes; spread evenly over beef mixture. Top each with remaining cheddar; bake in 350°F (180°C) oven until lightly golden, about 25 minutes. Broil until topping is rich golden-brown, about 3 minutes if desired.

Makes 4 to 5 servings.

Buttermilk Mashed Potatoes: Cover 1-1/2 lb (750 g) potatoes, peeled and cubed, with cold salted water in medium saucepan. Bring to boil over medium-high heat; reduce heat and simmer until tender, about 25 minutes. Drain and return to pot over medium heat; heat until dry, about 1 minute. Remove from heat. Stir in 1/2 cup buttermilk and 1/4 cup butter; mash until smooth.</p>
